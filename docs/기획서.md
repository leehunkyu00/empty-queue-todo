Product Specification: Empty-Queue Gamified Todo List Web App
Overview and Objectives
This document describes a web-based Todo List application that combines an “Empty Queue” time-blocking paradigm with game-inspired motivational mechanics. The goal is to help users focus on important work in dedicated time blocks (e.g. Deep Work vs. administrative tasks) while staying motivated through rewards and leveling up. The app is initially web-only (desktop and mobile web, with potential for a mobile webview container later). It features a minimalistic, clean UI for clarity and ease of use, and uses a modern Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB for data storage.
Key objectives include: enabling users to manage tasks in queues (e.g. a “Deep Work” queue for high-focus tasks and an “Admin” queue for shallow tasks), encouraging them to empty each queue regularly (similar in spirit to achieving “inbox zero”), and boosting engagement through gamification (points, levels, badges, etc.). The system supports a multi-user model under one account – for example, a parent can create sub-accounts for children to manage and motivate their tasks. All features are designed with an emphasis on simplicity and intuitiveness in the user experience.
Features by Module
Queue Management Module
•	Time-Block Queues: Users manage tasks via themed queues corresponding to time blocks or work categories. By default, the app provides two queues – a Deep Work Queue for focused, high-impact tasks and an Admin Queue for quick or routine tasks (shallow work). This separation aligns with productivity best practices: batching shallow tasks into a specific block lets users power through them efficiently, freeing the rest of the day for deeper work[1]. Users are encouraged to empty each queue during its allotted time block (e.g. finish all Deep Work tasks during a morning focus session). An empty queue represents success for that period, providing a clear “done for now” endpoint.
•	Queue Customization: In future iterations (or optionally in the MVP), users can rename default queues or add new ones to fit their workflow (e.g. a “Learning” queue or “Chores” queue for a child). Each queue can have an associated icon/color and an optional scheduled time. For MVP, the two default queues are fixed to reduce complexity, but their concepts (deep vs. shallow tasks) can be explained to the user during onboarding.
•	Queue Ordering & Focus: Within each queue, tasks are arranged in a prioritized order (like a true queue). The UI for a queue is a simple list of tasks where the top item is the next to tackle. Users can reorder tasks via drag-and-drop to plan the execution sequence. During a focus session, the app may highlight one task at a time (focus mode) to help concentration. The design remains minimal – e.g. a single-task view with a progress bar or timer, and a clear indication of how many tasks remain in the queue.
•	Empty State Feedback: When a queue has no remaining tasks (i.e. is “empty”), the app provides positive feedback. For example, an empty Deep Work queue might display a congratulatory message or subtle animation (confetti), reinforcing the achievement. This taps into the satisfaction of “clearing” a list, similar to reaching inbox zero. It may also reward bonus points (see Gamification) for emptying a queue. The empty state screen is clean and encouraging, inviting the user to either add new tasks or relax until the next time block.
Task Management Module
•	Task Creation & Assignment: Users (or a parent for their child) can create tasks with a title, description, and optional metadata (due date, estimated duration, difficulty level, etc.). Each task must be assigned to a queue upon creation – this ensures it’s slated for a specific focus block. (If users prefer to do a quick “inbox” capture of tasks without categorizing, the app can provide a general “Unassigned” list, but tasks in it should be minimal and sorted into a queue during daily planning.) Assigning every task to a queue enforces intentional planning: “What block will I do this in?”.
•	Time Blocking & Scheduling: The app encourages scheduling tasks into time blocks. Users can specify when they plan to work on a queue (e.g. “Deep Work queue at 9–11 AM daily, Admin queue at 4 PM daily”). In the UI, this might be represented by labels or a simple calendar interface. For MVP, this can be kept flexible (e.g. a note on the queue or a daily reminder) rather than a full calendar sync. The key idea is that tasks in the Deep Work queue are tackled during a dedicated deep work session, and Admin tasks are batched into a separate session – a practice known to improve efficiency and focus[2][1].
•	Task Execution & Completion: When it’s time for a scheduled block, the user opens the respective queue and works through tasks in order. Marking a task as complete immediately removes it from the queue. The UI for marking complete is a simple, intuitive gesture (e.g. a checkbox or swipe). Upon completion, the user instantly receives feedback (points, visual progress) as described in Gamification. Completed tasks might briefly show a “Done” state or animation then disappear, keeping the interface uncluttered. All completed tasks are recorded (in a history or log) for progress tracking and potential undo.
•	Task Details & Editing: Clicking a task shows its details (description, any sub-tasks or notes, due date if set, etc.) in a minimal overlay or side panel. From there, users can edit the task, reassign it to a different queue or user, or delete it. Edits are kept simple and focused – minimal form fields and a clean layout – to encourage quick adjustments without distraction.
•	Reminders & Notifications: (If in scope) Users can set due dates/times or deadlines on tasks, which trigger reminders. The system can send an email or push notification (for PWA/mobile use) when a task’s time block is starting or when a task is due. For example, “Your Admin block starts in 15 minutes” or “Time to start your Deep Work session.” MVP may implement basic email reminders or on-screen alerts rather than full push notifications, focusing on core functionality first.
User System Module
•	Accounts and Roles: The app supports a primary account holder and multiple sub-users under that account. A Parent (Primary User) can create profiles for Child Users (or generally, sub-users) that they manage. Each user (parent or child) has a profile with basic info (name, email/username, avatar or color theme) and their own set of queues and tasks. By default, a child’s account might use the same Deep Work/Admin queue concept (with the parent helping to define what tasks go in each), though the terminology can be adjusted for context (e.g. a parent might interpret “Deep Work” for a child as homework/study tasks and “Admin” as chores or routine tasks).
•	Authentication & Access: Users sign up with an email and password (or SSO options in future) and are authenticated via secure methods (e.g. JWT tokens for the web client or secure cookies). A parent can add a child by creating a sub-user profile (with a username/password or a quick code login). Child users can log in separately (e.g. on their own device via the web app) but with limited access scope – they can view and complete their tasks and see their own rewards, but cannot create other users or change system settings. The parent account has admin privileges to manage all sub-accounts (add/remove children, reset passwords) and to create/assign tasks for any child. All API requests enforce these access controls (for instance, a child user ID cannot access another child’s data or certain endpoints reserved for parents).
•	Multi-User Task Assignment: A parent user can assign tasks to their children’s queues. For example, a parent might add a “Clean your room” task to the child’s Admin queue or a “Finish math worksheet” task to the Deep Work queue of the child. The child will then see that task in their list. In the database, tasks have an assignedTo field referencing the user (child) and possibly a createdBy referencing who created it (to track that a parent assigned it). The UI allows the parent to switch context or view each child’s queues and progress easily, perhaps via a dropdown of profiles or a dashboard that lists all children and their current queue statuses (e.g. how many tasks remaining).
•	Profile Dashboard: Each user (parent or child) can have a simple dashboard screen showing their overall progress and settings. For a child, it might show their current level, total XP, coins, and recent badges earned (see Gamification), all with a friendly minimal interface. For a parent, the dashboard can show aggregate info (e.g. total tasks completed across the family, or an overview of each child’s level and task completion rate). Again, the design remains clean: e.g. a concise list of stats or a simple chart of tasks done this week. Personalization options (like choosing a theme color or avatar icon) can be available but are kept subtle to maintain the minimal aesthetic.
•	Privacy and Security: The system stores passwords securely (hashed) and does not share data between unrelated accounts. For child accounts, minimal personal data is collected (just a first name or nickname, perhaps an age bracket if needed for tailoring content). All communication is over HTTPS. These considerations ensure a safe environment, especially important if used for children’s tasks.
Gamification Module
•	Experience Points (XP) & Levels: Every time a user completes a task, they earn XP. The amount could be fixed (e.g. 10 XP per task) or variable based on task attributes (e.g. higher difficulty or longer estimated tasks give more XP). As XP accumulates, the user levels up once certain thresholds are reached. The level is a visible indicator of progress and long-term achievement. A progress bar or level meter is displayed in the UI, filling up as the user gains XP towards the next level – seeing a progress bar inch closer to full is highly motivating for users[3]. Each new level might come with a fun acknowledgment (e.g. “Level 5 reached! 🎉”) and possibly a reward (like coins or a badge). The leveling system can be calibrated such that each level requires slightly more XP than the last, introducing increasing difficulty to keep users challenged as they progress (a common game design tactic).
•	Coins & Virtual Rewards: In addition to XP, completing tasks yields virtual coins. Coins are a secondary reward currency. They can be used for in-app rewards or simply serve as a score. For example, coins might allow users (especially kids) to “buy” cosmetic upgrades in the app (like new theme colors, avatar accessories in a future update) or could be exchanged for real-life rewards defined by a parent (outside the app). The MVP will track coins and display them on the user’s dashboard. Even if not immediately spendable, seeing coins accumulate provides positive reinforcement. (In future, a reward store or mechanism to utilize coins can be introduced; MVP will focus on earning them.)
•	Badges & Achievements: The app awards badges when users hit certain milestones or perform noteworthy actions. For instance, badges could include: “Deep Focus: Emptied the Deep Work queue 5 days in a row”, “Task Slayer: Completed 100 tasks”, or “Streak Starter: Emptied all queues in a day”. Badges come with titles and maybe a minimal icon. They appear in the user’s profile as collectibles. Earning badges provides a sense of accomplishment and can drive users to try new challenges (for example, aiming for a streak badge motivates consistent daily use). Recognitions like points, badges, and levels have real significance for users – when awarded for hard work, they are huge motivators that keep people engaged[3].
•	Feedback and Visual Cues: Gamification elements are woven into the UI in a subtle, non-distracting way. For example: when a task is checked off, a small XP gain popup might briefly appear (“+10 XP”) and the XP progress bar updates in real-time. Level-ups might trigger a simple celebratory animation or modal. The design keeps these elements clean and minimalist – e.g. a simple burst animation or confetti that quickly fades, avoiding anything too cartoonish or cluttered in the core workflow. The aim is to provide immediate feedback and a dopamine hit for completing tasks, tapping into the brain’s reward system[4][3]. This kind of real-time feedback loop is known to increase motivation and make even mundane chores feel a bit more like a fun challenge[4].
•	Difficulty and Progression: The gamified system adjusts to the user’s progress. Early on, levels are easier to achieve, giving new users quick wins. As they advance, the required XP per level increases, pacing the experience so that leveling up remains an achievement. If tasks have a difficulty setting, that can integrate here: e.g. marking a task as “Hard” could give 2× XP, whereas “Easy” tasks give the base XP. This encourages users to challenge themselves with tougher tasks for greater reward. Parents assigning tasks to children might set higher difficulty for tasks that require more effort, thereby granting the child more points for completing them – a way to incentivize harder tasks. Over time, the user is effectively “playing” their productivity system like a game, where doing more and harder tasks leads to leveling up and recognition.
•	Social/Competitive Elements: (Future consideration) While MVP is focused on personal and family use, the gamification system could later introduce friendly competition – e.g. a leaderboard among family members or the ability to share achievements with friends. Leaderboards leverage the human desire for recognition and can spur engagement[5]. For now, within a family account, a parent might optionally enable a view of all child users’ levels or badges to encourage a bit of competition or collective progress (“kids, let’s all try to empty our queues today!”). The app, however, will not expose any data publicly – any competitive element is confined to the private group for privacy.
Design and UX Considerations
(Cross-cutting module for UI/UX)
- Extremely Minimal Interface: The design philosophy is to keep every screen uncluttered and intuitive. The color scheme is light and minimal (e.g. lots of white/neutral space, one accent color for highlights/progress). Typography is clean and legible. Every element on screen serves a purpose; unnecessary ornamentation or complex menus are avoided. For instance, the main dashboard might just show two cards for the two queues with their current status (number of tasks, next task title, and a clear “Start” button for the session). Gamification elements (points, level, etc.) are visible but not overwhelming – perhaps displayed in a small corner or under the profile, visible at a glance but not detracting from the task list.
- Intuitive Task Interaction: Common actions are designed to be obvious. Adding a task is done via a prominent “+” button or input field at the top of each queue list. Completing a task uses a familiar checkbox or swipe-to-complete pattern. Dragging tasks to re-order uses standard drag handles. All interactions should feel natural to users of existing to-do apps, so the learning curve is minimal. Tooltips or a brief tutorial might be provided during onboarding to introduce the queue concept and gamification features.
- Responsive Web Design: The web app is fully responsive, providing a good experience on desktops, tablets, and phones (since mobile users will access it via browser or webview). On smaller screens, the layout might shift to a tabbed interface (e.g. tabs for each queue, plus a tab for profile/rewards) instead of a side-by-side view. The minimal design aids responsiveness because it relies on simple layouts (lists, cards, modals) that naturally adapt to different screen sizes.
- Accessibility: The interface uses high-contrast text and supports screen reader labels for key buttons (add task, complete task, etc.), ensuring it’s accessible to users with disabilities. Icons have text or tooltip alternatives. The aim is for the app to be usable by a wide range of ages – from a motivated student or busy professional to a parent managing a child’s tasks. Simplicity in design directly contributes to accessibility and ease of understanding for all users.
- Consistency and Feedback: Every user action gets immediate feedback: e.g., tapping “complete” crosses out the task and shows an XP gain animation instantly. Navigation is consistent – for example, a back button or navigation bar is always in the same place. Confirmation prompts (using minimal modal dialogs) are used for destructive actions like deleting a task or removing a user. The overall UX should feel lightweight yet engaging – the user should feel in control and never overwhelmed by the interface, with the game mechanics adding fun but not confusion.
Example UX Flows
To illustrate how users interact with the system, here are a few key use-case flows:
•	Onboarding a New User (Primary Account):
•	Sign-Up: The user lands on the sign-up page and creates an account with email and password. They verify their email if required (MVP could skip verification for simplicity).
•	Create Profile: They enter a name and choose an avatar icon/color. If the user is a parent or intends to manage others, they can indicate this now or in settings later.
•	Add Sub-Users (Optional): If the user says they have family/team members to manage, the app prompts to add sub-accounts. For example, the user adds a child’s name (and perhaps age) and either sets a login password for the child or chooses to stay in “managed mode” (where the child will use the app under the parent’s supervision). They can add multiple children at this step. This step can be skipped, meaning the user will just manage their own tasks.
•	Initial Queue Setup Intro: The app briefly explains the Empty Queue paradigm – e.g., a quick slide or illustration: “We’ve created two queues for you: Deep Work (for your most important focus tasks) and Admin (for quick tasks & chores). The goal is to empty each queue during its scheduled time!” The user is then asked to set a schedule (optional): e.g. pick a time of day for Deep Work and one for Admin work. If they skip, default suggestions are used (say 9am for Deep Work, 4pm for Admin).
•	First Task Creation: As part of onboarding, the app may prompt: “Let’s add your first task.” The user is guided to enter a task (perhaps one example for Deep Work, like “Finish project report”) and assign it to the Deep Work queue, then another (e.g. “Check emails”) to Admin queue. This teaches how to add tasks and assign queues.
•	Tour Gamification: Finally, a quick tour pop-up highlights the XP bar and coins: “Complete tasks to earn XP and level up! 🎮 Each task also gives you coins and could unlock badges. Check your Profile to see your progress.” This ensures the user understands the motivational features from the start. The user can then proceed to the main app view.
•	Daily Planning & Queue Management Flow:
Scenario: Each morning, Alice (a user) plans her day using the app.
•	Review Queues: Alice opens the app and goes to her dashboard. She sees two queues: Deep Work (3 tasks pending) and Admin (5 tasks pending). She also notices she’s close to the next level on her XP bar – extra motivation to get things done today.
•	Add/Organize Tasks: Alice has a new task in mind (“Prepare slides for meeting”). She clicks the “+” on the Deep Work queue to add it, sets an estimate of 2 hours, and it appears in the list. She drags this task to the top of the Deep Work queue, deciding it’s highest priority. In the Admin queue, she quickly reorders tasks so that “Email John about budget” is first, since that’s important to do in her admin block.
•	Time Allocation: Using the scheduling aid, Alice blocks 9-11am for Deep Work. She sees that her Deep Work queue has 4 tasks; based on her estimates, they should fit in the 2 hours. At 11:30am, she allots 30 minutes for the Admin queue tasks. (She does this mentally or using the app’s schedule UI if available – e.g. dragging the queue onto a timeline). The app might highlight if the planned tasks likely won’t fit the time (if total estimated time > block length), helping her adjust expectations.
•	Work Session Start: At 9am, Alice gets a notification or sees a prompt: “Time to Deep Work! 4 tasks queued.” She enters Focus Mode on the Deep Work queue. The interface now shows her first task (“Prepare slides”) with a small timer and the list of tasks in that queue accessible. She works on it without distractions.
•	Task Execution & Completion (Focus Session) Flow:
Continuing Alice’s day:
•	Completing Tasks: Alice finishes “Prepare slides” and checks it off. Instantly, a small “+20 XP” pops up and her level progress bar moves. The task disappears from the list. She feels a sense of accomplishment from the feedback. The next Deep Work task (“Draft report section”) automatically comes into focus.
•	Short Breaks & Pausing: After two tasks, Alice decides to take a short break. She pauses the timer (if one is running) in the focus mode. The app shows a calming break screen or simply goes back to the dashboard. The Deep Work queue now shows “2 tasks left”. Alice can resume the session when ready.
•	Emptying the Queue: By 10:45am, Alice completes the last task in her Deep Work queue. When she checks it off, she not only gets XP and coins for that task, but a special message appears: “🎉 You emptied your Deep Work queue! +50 XP bonus”. The queue list now is empty, showing an encouraging quote or graphic. Alice has achieved “queue zero” for the morning. She also notices a badge unlocked – “Deep Focus (Empty a Deep Work queue in a day)” – which pops up with a small icon. Feeling satisfied, she ends her deep work session a bit early.
•	Admin Session: Later, at 11:30, the app reminds her about the Admin block. Alice opens it and quickly goes through the smaller tasks (replying to John, checking some emails, scheduling a meeting). Each completion gives a few XP. She manages to finish all admin tasks in the 30-minute window. The Admin queue empties out, and she gets another bonus reward and perhaps a streak count increment (e.g. “2 queues cleared today!”). Now both of her queues are empty – she’s effectively done all planned work for the day. The app might display a summary: “All queues empty! Great job – enjoy your free time 🏆.” This positive reinforcement encourages her to maintain this habit.
•	Parent Assigning Tasks & Child Execution Flow:
Scenario: John is a parent using the app to motivate his 10-year-old son, Tim, to do homework and chores.
•	Parent Adds Task for Child: John opens Tim’s profile in the app. He sees Tim’s Deep Work queue (schoolwork) and Admin queue (chores). John adds a task “Math Homework Chapter 2” to Tim’s Deep Work queue, sets it as “Hard” difficulty (so Tim will earn extra XP), and due for today. He also adds “Take out trash” to Tim’s Admin queue (easy task).
•	Child Gets Notification: Tim, on his tablet, gets an alert (or sees on login) that he has 2 new tasks for today. The interface is child-friendly but still the same minimalist style. Tim starts his Deep Work queue after school. The first task is math homework. It’s long, but he knows he’ll get a lot of XP because Dad marked it as Hard.
•	Gamified Motivation for Child: As Tim completes sections of his homework, maybe John set it up as sub-tasks or Tim just marks it done when finished – Tim checks off “Math Homework Chapter 2”. He immediately gets, say, 30 XP and 5 coins. A fun animation plays (appropriate for kids, e.g. a small pixelated trophy icon) and Tim levels up to Level 3. He’s excited to show his dad that he leveled up. He then switches to the Admin queue and does the trash chore. When done, he empties that queue and gets a badge “All chores done!”.
•	Parent Reviews Progress: That evening, John opens the app and sees Tim’s dashboard. It shows Tim’s level, XP, and that Tim earned the “Chore Champ” badge today. John can send an encouraging comment or simply give Tim a high-five in person. The app did the job of motivating Tim with virtual rewards – 90% of kids using gamified task systems like this complete all their assigned tasks[6], and indeed Tim got everything done. This flow demonstrates how the parent-child dynamic is enhanced: the parent assigns and oversees, while the child is driven by the game mechanics to actually do the tasks.
•	Reward and Profile Experience Flow:
Scenario: A user checks their profile to see progress and redeem rewards.
•	Viewing Profile: After a week of usage, Alice opens her Profile page. She sees her avatar, current level (Level 6), total XP (e.g. 1500 XP), and coins collected (e.g. 120 coins). There’s a horizontal progress bar 80% filled toward Level 7. Below, her badge collection is displayed as a grid of icons. Some are colored (earned) and some gray (not yet earned), encouraging her to collect more. She’s earned badges like “Task Streak (completed tasks 5 days straight)” and “Deep Focus”. Each badge can be tapped for a description. The layout is simple and trophy-like without being overly gamey – it fits within the clean design.
•	Interpreting Stats: Alice scrolls to a small stats section: “Tasks completed this week: 18”, “Queues emptied: 8”, “Longest daily streak: 3 days”. These statistics give her insight into her productivity habits. If implemented, a minimal chart might show tasks done per day. Alice notices she didn’t empty both queues on Tuesday, breaking her streak, so she sets a goal to try for a longer streak next time.
•	Using Coins (future feature): If the app store or rewards were implemented, Alice might click a “Rewards” tab where she can spend her 120 coins. For MVP this might not exist, but in future, this could show items like “Custom Theme – 100 coins” or allow her to convert coins to some voucher if partnerships exist. In our current scope, she just views the coin count as a secondary score.
•	Settings: Alice also uses this section to tweak settings – e.g. she adjusts her Admin queue’s default time to 30 minutes instead of 1 hour, and changes a child’s avatar, etc. The profile/settings area maintains the sparse aesthetic with clear labels and toggles. Once done, she logs out or returns to the task view, ready for another productive day.
These flows demonstrate a seamless integration of planning, execution, and reward. At each step, the user knows what to do next, gets positive reinforcement for progress, and can easily manage their or their family’s tasks.
Data Model and Schema (MongoDB)
The application will use MongoDB as the primary database. The data is modeled in a document-oriented way, with collections for the main entities. Below is a suggested schema design for the MVP:
•	Users Collection: Stores user accounts (both primary and sub-users). Each user document could include:
•	_id: Unique identifier for the user (ObjectId).
•	name: The user’s name or display name.
•	email: Email address (for login, only present for primary users or any user with direct login).
•	passwordHash: Hashed password for authentication (if the user can log in). Child accounts may optionally inherit the parent’s credentials or have their own.
•	role: Role of the user – e.g. "parent" (primary) or "child" (sub-user). Alternatively, a boolean like isPrimary could be used.
•	parentId: If this user is a child account, parentId references the User _id of the parent. Primary users have parentId: null. This establishes the one-to-many relationship (one parent -> many children).
•	children: (Optional for convenience) Array of child user IDs belonging to the parent. This can be derived by querying, so it may not be necessary to store, but could be included for quick access.
•	queues: (If using dynamic queues) An array of queue definitions for this user. For MVP with fixed Deep/Admin, this might not be needed; but if flexible, each element could have queueId, name (e.g. "Deep Work"), and perhaps scheduling info (like default time or target duration). Alternatively, we implement queues as their own collection (see below).
•	Gamification Fields:
o	xp: Cumulative experience points the user has earned.
o	level: Current level of the user (could be derived from xp, but storing can simplify queries).
o	coins: Current coin balance.
o	badges: An array of badge identifiers that the user has earned (could store badge codes or IDs referencing a Badge catalog). E.g. ["STREAK5", "DEEP_FOCUS"].
o	streak: (Optional) Current daily streak count of completing all queues, if that feature is used. Could also store maxStreak to track the longest streak achieved.
o	Timestamps: e.g. createdAt, lastLogin for auditing.
•	Tasks Collection: Stores individual tasks/to-do items. Each task document includes:
•	_id: Unique task ID.
•	title: Short description of the task.
•	description: Longer details (if any). Keep minimal – e.g. plain text or markdown.
•	assignedTo: The _id of the user who is supposed to do the task. For a personal task, this is the user themselves; for a parent-assigned task, this is the child’s user ID. This links tasks to specific users/owners.
•	createdBy: The _id of the user who created the task. Usually the same as assignedTo for personal tasks; for delegated tasks, this would be the parent’s ID (indicating it was assigned by that parent). This helps with audit trails and permissions (a parent can mark a task as done on behalf of child if needed, etc.).
•	queue: The category/queue this task belongs to. For MVP, this can be a string enum: e.g. "deep" or "admin" (or "deep_work"/"admin"). If custom queues are allowed, this might be a reference to a queue ID in a Queue collection or a user-defined category name.
•	status: Current status of the task. Likely values: "pending" (or "open"), "completed", maybe "expired" or "deleted" for edge cases. Completed tasks might either be kept in the collection with status marked, or moved to an archive (for simplicity, we keep them with a status flag).
•	dueDate: (Optional) Date/time by which the task should be done. Useful for scheduling notifications or indicating urgency. Could be null for tasks that are just in the queue without a hard deadline.
•	scheduledTime: (Optional) The specific time block or session assigned (could be a timestamp or a label like “today morning” if we have an internal representation). MVP might not need a full calendar integration – tasks are implicitly scheduled by virtue of being in a queue that has a planned time. But if a user explicitly schedules a task for a certain hour, that timestamp can be stored here.
•	estimate: (Optional) Estimated duration (in minutes or a time interval) if the user provided one. This can help in planning and is informational.
•	difficulty: (Optional) A rating (e.g. 1-3 or “easy/medium/hard”) which can influence XP. If set, the app can calculate XP as base * difficulty factor.
•	points: (Optional) If we want to store the exact point value a task is worth (e.g. 10 XP), we could either compute it on the fly or store it. Likely not needed to store since it’s formulaic (based on difficulty or default).
•	completedAt: Timestamp of completion (set when status turns completed). This helps in calculating daily streaks or history.
•	Timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt.
•	Queue Collection: (Optional, depending on design) If we allow custom queues or want to store scheduling info, a separate queues collection might exist. A queue document could include:
•	_id: Queue ID.
•	userId: Owner (the user to whom this queue belongs; e.g. each child or parent can have their own set of queues).
•	name: Name of the queue (e.g. "Deep Work").
•	icon/color: (Optional) UI info for the queue’s display.
•	schedule: (Optional) default schedule info (e.g. daily at 9am, or Mon-Fri 9-11am). Could store a cron-like pattern or a simple note.
•	order: (Optional) an index if we want to order multiple queues in the UI.
For MVP with two fixed queues, we might skip this collection and simply handle two known queues in code. However, using this collection from the start can make it easier to expand later. Each user upon creation would get two queue entries (Deep Work, Admin) by default.
•	Badges/Achievements Collection: A static collection defining all possible badges (achievements) in the system. This allows easy expansion and localization of badge criteria. Each badge document might have:
•	_id or code: Identifier like "STREAK5" or an ObjectId.
•	name: Short name (e.g. "5-Day Streak").
•	description: Description of criteria (e.g. "Empty all your queues 5 days in a row").
•	icon: Icon image or class reference for display (could be an URL or a sprite position).
•	criteria: A structured field describing how to earn it (this could be in human terms or a rule engine pointer – for MVP, criteria can just be described and the logic to award is in code).
•	Possibly pointsReward: if earning a badge grants bonus XP or coins, that could be noted.
The app logic will reference this collection to know when to award a badge (e.g. after completing a task, check if any badge criteria met like hitting 100 tasks etc.). Users’ earned badges are stored in their user profile as mentioned.
•	Rewards Store (Future): If coins will be spendable, a storeItems collection could list items that can be purchased with coins (e.g. "Theme Pack – 100 coins"). Not in MVP scope, so just noted for future planning.
•	Logs (Optional): To support analytics or future features, we might keep an activity log collection (e.g. TaskLog or XPLog) that records each task completion or reward event (user X completed task Y at time Z, gained N XP). This can help in debugging or generating detailed reports. For MVP, this is not strictly necessary, but the data model can accommodate it later without affecting the core.
Relationships and Access Patterns: All major data is linked by user IDs. For example, to get a child’s tasks, the system will query Tasks by assignedTo = childId. A parent viewing all tasks could query tasks for any of their children (the app would either do multiple queries or one query with assignedTo in [list_of_child_ids]). Since MongoDB is schema-less, we ensure through application logic that, for instance, only parent users have children arrays, only child tasks have a parent in createdBy, etc. We’ll create necessary indexes (e.g. on assignedTo for tasks, on parentId for users) to keep lookups efficient.
The use of MongoDB’s document model allows some embedding if needed. For instance, one could embed a child’s tasks within the child user document if tasks were small in number. However, tasks can grow indefinitely, so a separate collection is more flexible. Similarly, badge IDs are small and can be embedded in the User doc for quick access, while their definitions are in a separate collection.
This schema aims for clarity and simplicity to match the app’s needs. During implementation, an ODM like Mongoose can be used to enforce these structures and relationships.
Component-Level Architecture
The system follows a classic web application architecture with a clear separation between the front-end client and back-end server, and uses a MongoDB database. Below is a breakdown of the components and how they interact:
•	Front-End (Client): The front-end is a single-page web application (SPA) implemented with modern web technologies (e.g. React or Vue). It is delivered as a static bundle over HTTPS and runs in the user’s browser. The UI is responsible for rendering the task lists, forms, and gamification feedback. It communicates with the backend via HTTP(S) requests (likely a JSON REST API). Key front-end components/pages include:
•	Login/Signup pages – for authentication.
•	Dashboard/Home – shows queues and overall status.
•	Queue page or section – listing tasks in a queue and managing them.
•	Task detail modal/form – to add/edit tasks.
•	Profile/Rewards page – shows levels, badges, settings.
•	The front-end handles local state for interactivity and uses minimal state management (perhaps a library like Redux/Vuex if needed). It also handles session tokens (storing a JWT or session ID cookie) to include in API calls. Crucially, the front-end enforces some UI-level rules (e.g. disabling certain buttons for child users), but authorization is primarily handled server-side for security.
•	Webview/Mobile: Because the app is web-based, it can be wrapped in a WebView for mobile apps or simply accessed via mobile browsers. The responsive design ensures usability on small screens. No native mobile code is needed for MVP aside from an optional WebView wrapper.
•	Back-End (Server): The back-end is built with Node.js and Express (as suggested for complementing MongoDB). It serves two main purposes: a RESTful API for client interactions, and the business logic for task management and gamification.
•	The server defines REST API endpoints such as:
o	POST /auth/signup, POST /auth/login – for authentication.
o	GET /users/me – get current user profile (and maybe their children profiles if parent).
o	POST /users – (parent only) create a child account.
o	GET /tasks?assignedTo={userId} – get tasks for a user (child or self).
o	POST /tasks – create a new task.
o	PUT /tasks/{id} – update task (mark complete or edit).
o	POST /tasks/{id}/complete – mark a task as completed (could also be done via PUT).
o	GET /badges – list of all badges (for profile display, could be cached on client).
o	etc.
•	Business Logic & Modules: The server-side code will be organized into modules corresponding to features:
o	Queue Logic: Not much separate logic needed since queue is mostly a field on tasks; but if scheduling or complex planning algorithms (like suggesting how many tasks fit in a block) are added, that would live on the server or a utility library.
o	Task Management: Handles CRUD on tasks, ensures a task belongs to the requester or their child. Might also implement logic like preventing adding too many tasks in a queue (if we impose limits to encourage focus).
o	User Management: Handles creating sub-accounts, retrieving child lists, permission checks. Also manages authentication (issuing JWT tokens on login, hashing passwords). Possibly uses a library like Passport.js for auth.
o	Gamification Engine: On certain events (task completion, daily check-in, etc.), the backend triggers gamification updates. For example, when a task is marked complete, the server-side logic will:
o	Calculate XP earned (perhaps base XP * difficulty).
o	Update the user’s XP and coins in the database (atomic operation to increment).
o	Check if the XP now crosses a level threshold -> if yes, increment level and possibly return a response indicating level-up.
o	Check badge criteria: e.g. if user completed 10th task, award “10 Tasks” badge by adding to user’s badge list; if they emptied all queues today, award the streak badge, etc.
o	These checks can be done synchronously on each completion or in a background job. MVP can handle them inline for simplicity (the small scale should be fine).
o	Notification Service: If implementing reminders, the server might have a scheduler or integrate with a service (like cron jobs or use a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging for push). Initially, sending a simple email or in-app notification when the client is online can be done. The backend would have endpoints or cron triggers for these (e.g. a daily job at 9am to send “Deep Work time!” notification to relevant users).
•	Express Middleware: The server uses middleware for tasks like JSON parsing, logging, and authentication checking. For example, an authMiddleware will verify the JWT on each request and attach the user info to the request context. Another middleware might check role permissions (ensuring a child cannot access admin endpoints, etc.). Rate limiting and security middleware (Helmet, etc.) will be applied as needed.
•	Database (MongoDB): The MongoDB database stores all persistent data as outlined in the schema section. We might use a cloud MongoDB service (MongoDB Atlas) for reliability. The Node.js server communicates with MongoDB (via Mongoose ODM or the native driver) to perform queries and updates.
•	Data design is done to minimize overly complex transactions. For instance, updating XP and awarding a badge might be two updates; we ensure either those operations are done in sequence or we design badge awarding to be idempotent (so if one fails, it can recover). MongoDB’s support for multi-document transactions can be used if needed when multiple collections must update together (not likely needed in MVP if we keep most user stats in one document).
•	The database will have indexes on key fields like assignedTo (in tasks) and parentId (in users) for performance, since those are common query patterns.
•	Integration & External Services: For MVP, external integration is minimal. Possible integrations include:
•	Email service (SMTP or a service like SendGrid) for sending welcome emails or task reminders.
•	If push notifications are desired for the web, using service workers and a push service could be considered (though possibly later).
•	Logging/analytics services to track usage (could integrate something like Google Analytics on front-end or log events to an internal collection). These are not core to the product functionality and can be added as needed. The architecture keeps them modular.
•	Front-End/Back-End Interaction: The front-end communicates with the back-end via REST API calls. For example, when a user marks a task complete in the UI, the front-end sends a POST /tasks/{id}/complete request. The server processes it (authenticates, updates DB, calculates XP, etc.) and responds with the updated task data and any new rewards (for instance, the response might include the user’s new XP total or a flag that they leveled up). The front-end then updates the UI (XP bar, etc.) accordingly. Real-time updates are not critical here, so polling or simply refreshing data after actions is sufficient. If we wanted, we could use WebSockets or server-sent events for things like real-time leaderboard updates or parent seeing child’s task completion in real-time, but that is beyond MVP scope. Simpler: the parent’s app could refresh the child’s status when they open the child’s view.
•	Security & Authorization: The architecture ensures that all critical checks happen on the server. Even though the front-end will hide admin functions from child users, the server will also verify (e.g., if a child tries to call an endpoint to create a new user, it will be rejected by checking their role from the JWT). Data separation is achieved by always scoping queries to the current user or their sub-users. For example, GET /tasks for a child user will automatically filter tasks by their userId. A parent’s request might allow filtering by a childId that the parent owns – the server will check that the child’s parentId matches the requesting parent. This ensures no cross-account data leaks.
Overall, the system is a straightforward three-tier architecture: a presentation layer (browser app), an application layer (Node/Express server), and a data layer (MongoDB). This setup is chosen for its simplicity and alignment with the technology stack: Node and MongoDB pair well for JSON data and rapid development, and the SPA front-end allows a smooth, interactive user experience that can be easily packaged into a mobile container later. The modular design (separating concerns of auth, tasks, gamification, etc.) will make it maintainable and scalable as features grow.
MVP Scope Definition
It’s important to define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to focus on core functionality and deliver value quickly. Below is the scope of the MVP, as well as what is deferred for later versions:
Included in MVP (Core Features):
- Task Queues (Deep Work & Admin): Two default queues per user with the ability to add tasks, reorder them, and mark them complete. The concept of emptying the queue as a daily goal is emphasized. (Custom queues or more than two categories are not in MVP – keeping it simple with the proven deep vs shallow split.)
- Basic Time-Blocking Concept: The app will encourage scheduling (and possibly allow setting a daily reminder time for each queue), but a full calendar interface or complex conflict handling is not included. MVP may simply use textual labels like “Morning” or “Evening” for intended time blocks, or just rely on user discipline.
- User Accounts & Multi-User: Account creation, login, and password authentication. One primary user can create and manage multiple child accounts. Children can log in (with credentials or a simple code) to view their own task lists and mark tasks done. The parent can switch between profiles to manage tasks. The permission model (parent vs child capabilities) is enforced.
- Task CRUD: Ability to create tasks (with title, description, assign to a queue and user), edit tasks (at least title/description and maybe reassign queue or due date), and delete tasks. Marking complete is the primary action. Tasks can have an optional due date and estimated duration, but these might be lightly used in MVP (no complex recurrence or dependency handling in MVP).
- Gamification – Points & Levels: Core game mechanics operational. Completing tasks yields XP and possibly coins. The user’s XP and level are tracked and displayed. Level-ups occur as XP thresholds are met, with feedback to the user. The XP curve for leveling can be something simple (like 100 XP per level increase or a formula) to start with.
- Basic Rewards & Badges: A selection of a few badges to introduce the concept (for example: one for first task completed, one for 10 tasks, one for emptying a queue, one for a 3-day streak). These badges are awarded automatically when conditions are met and visible on the profile. The MVP will not include a very large catalog of badges – just enough to engage users initially and prove out the system.
- Coins Tally: Coins accumulate from tasks (e.g. 1 coin per task or some ratio). The coin balance is shown, but in MVP, coins are just a score – there is no spending or marketplace yet.
- Minimal UI/UX Implementation: The basic interface with the described minimal design: queue lists, add task form, profile page with XP/badges, login screens, etc. The UI will be functional and clean but might not have full polish or extensive animations in MVP. For instance, transitions and visual effects can be added later; MVP might use simple highlights or text notifications for feedback to save time. The design will still align with the minimal style guide (so we won’t compromise on simplicity, but we will limit the time spent on fancy visuals).
- Performance and Quality: The MVP will be fully usable and reasonably performant for a small number of users and tasks. Given the scope, this is not heavy – Node/Express and Mongo can easily handle the expected load of an early-stage app with modest usage. Basic testing will be done (unit tests for critical logic like XP calculation, integration tests for APIs) to ensure reliability.
Excluded or Deferred from MVP (Future Enhancements):
- Advanced Scheduling/Calendar Integration: For example, a calendar view of tasks or integration with external calendars (Google Calendar etc.) is not in MVP. Time blocking is kept conceptual; future versions might offer a drag-and-drop calendar or timetable UI for planning the week.
- Custom Queue Management: The ability for users to create more queues (beyond the defaults) or share templates of queues is deferred. MVP sticks to the two core queues which cover most needs (deep vs shallow work). If user research shows need for more, it will be added later.
- Recurring or Dependent Tasks: MVP treats all tasks as one-off. Features like repeating tasks (e.g. “every Monday”) or task dependencies (must finish Task A before Task B) are not included initially. These can complicate the scheduling logic and are left for a later phase once the basic usage is validated.
- Detailed Analytics/Reporting: While the profile shows simple stats, any heavy analytics (like weekly email reports, or charts of productivity over months) are out of scope in MVP. Similarly, admin dashboards for usage or other meta-analytics are not included yet.
- In-App Reward Redemption: There is no functionality to spend coins or claim real-life rewards in MVP. Parents will handle any real rewards for kids outside the app (e.g. they can agree “50 coins = an ice cream” on their own). A future update could introduce a rewards store or at least a way for a parent to mark a coin redemption (deduct coins in exchange for something), but initially, coins simply accumulate.
- Social/Community Features: MVP is focused on single-account use (one family or one individual). There is no cross-account social network, no public leaderboards, no friend lists. These could be brainstormed for the future (like families competing or sharing achievements on social media) but are not a priority for the first release.
- Mobile Native Apps: As noted, the app will be web-only in MVP. We will not develop separate native iOS/Android apps yet. However, the web app should be easily usable on mobile browsers. Later, we might wrap it as a native app or improve PWA capabilities (offline support, push notifications). For now, features like offline mode or background sync are not included.
- Extensive Gamification Expansion: There are many possible game-like features (e.g. a virtual pet to take care of, mini-games as rewards, narrative quests, etc. as seen in some apps). MVP will not include these heavy elements – we stick to points, levels, badges which are simpler to implement yet effective[3]. If user engagement is strong, we can consider adding more gamified experiences later.
- UI Polish and Animations: While the MVP UI will be clean and functional, some niceties might be postponed. For example, fancy animations on level-up, sound effects, or an in-depth tutorial sequence might be simplified. The emphasis is on verifying that users understand and enjoy the core loop (plan -> execute -> get reward) even with basic graphics. Future versions can then enhance the visual feedback (e.g. more lively animations, better illustrations on empty states, etc.).
By focusing on the above MVP scope, we ensure that the foundational features – managing tasks in queues and motivating the user through game mechanics – are delivered first and work correctly. This provides immediate value: users can improve their productivity and have fun doing so. Early feedback can then guide which deferred features are most desired for subsequent releases. The modular design of our system (with clear separation of concerns) will make it easier to add these new features over time without major refactoring.
Conclusion: This product aims to blend proven productivity techniques with engaging gamification to help users (and their families) get things done with less stress and more motivation. By starting with a solid MVP focusing on queue-based time blocking and a few key game elements, we lay the groundwork for a unique platform that can grow through user feedback. The minimal design ensures that, despite the many features under the hood, the user experience remains straightforward and enjoyable. With this specification in hand, the next steps would be to proceed into design prototypes and iterative development, validating the concept at each stage. The end result will ideally be a todo app that not only organizes your tasks, but makes you want to complete them – turning productivity into a rewarding game.
